# EnsitrelvirModel
Computational and mathematical model of the antiviral ensitrelvir for SARS-CoV-2

This is the supporting Monolix modeling materials and Python code to simulate the [SCORPIO-SR clinicial trial](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2814871) of the oral antiviral ensitrelvir for treating mild to moderate symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 in low-risk adults. This research elucidates the mechanisms behind a saturation of drug efficacy upon increased dosage of ensitrelvir in the clinical trial.
